Very nice!
Suggestions:
+ Break the AJAX calls happening in app.js into an adapter function and simplifying some of the if/else logic to make it easier to trace through
+ Suggest making the dropdown menu behavior its own function
+ Render functions look pretty good
+ In Article Adapter, suggest creating smaller methods to format the data before passing it in to create models
+ Like `renderAll()`
